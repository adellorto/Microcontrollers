# Microcontrollers

This repository collects my solutions to past exam exercises for the **Microcontrollers** course of the BSc in Electronics Engineering at **Politecnico di Milano**.

## Contents

All projects target the **Microchip PIC18F45K22** microcontroller and were developed with MikroC. The tasks involve LCD management, timers, ADC conversions, PWM based motor control and general digital I/O handling using interrupts.
